Sofia's Digital Portfolio

Hi There! Thanks for exploring my work. This portfolio is just a glimpse of some of my projects from various coursework as well as those I've done "just for fun!" While Data Visualization is my "thing," I am also adept at statistical testing, modeling, and interpretation. Enjoy, and feel free to reach out with questions or comments!
